# PyTorch Deep Q Learning For PyGame Snake

A project in which the Deep Q Learning method for playing snake was implemented using PyTorch.

The goal of the project was to implement DQN and train the algorithm on a simple game in PyGame to demonstrate how the algorithm works in practice.

## Getting Started

For this project I use the environment in Anaconda where I install PyTorch:

## Prerequisites

1. Create virtual enviroment with Anaconda
```
$ conda create -n python_env python=3.7
```
2. Activate your new enviroment
```
$ conda activate python_env
```

## Installation 
1. Install PyTorch & PyGame
```
$ pip install torch pygame
```

2. Run agent & snake game
```
$ python agent.py
```

## Usage

You can use this project for educational purposes to get acquainted with possible DQN implementation using PyTorch. Alternatively, you can just see how it all works together by running the agent and enjoying the algorithm learning :)
